## 🛠 Methodology

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
```python
# Key preprocessing steps implemented:
- Missing value handling (dropna)
- Categorical encoding using LabelEncoder
- Feature scaling (implicit in linear regression)
- Train-test split (80-20 ratio)
```

### 2. **Model Selection**
**Linear Regression** chosen because:
- **Interpretability**: Clear coefficient interpretation
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Baseline**: Good starting point for regression problems
- **Educational Value**: Demonstrates fundamental ML concepts

### 3. **Model Training**
```python
# Mathematical representation:
G3 = β₀ + β₁×age + β₂×gender + ... + β₁₃×G2 + ε

# Where:
- β₀ = intercept
- βᵢ = coefficient for feature i
- ε = error term
```

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**
- **R² Score**: Coefficient of determination
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute prediction error
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared prediction error
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of MSE

## 📈 Results & Performance

### Model Performance Metrics
```
R² Score:           0.8088 (80.88%)
MAE:               1.5177 points
MSE:               3.6830 points²
RMSE:              1.9191 points
```

### Performance Interpretation
- **Excellent Fit**: R² = 0.81 indicates model explains 81% of grade variance
- **High Accuracy**: RMSE = 1.92 means predictions typically within ±1.9 points
- **Practical Utility**: MAE = 1.52 shows average error of ~1.5 grade points

### Feature Importance Analysis
| Feature | Coefficient | Impact | Interpretation |
|---------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| study_time | +2.0406 | **Highest** | Each study hour level increases grade by ~2 points |
| failures | -1.4339 | **High** | Each failure decreases grade by ~1.4 points |
| G2 | +0.4003 | **Moderate** | Previous semester strongly predicts final grade |
| G1 | +0.3066 | **Moderate** | First semester grade is important predictor |
| activities | -0.2604 | **Low** | Extracurriculars show slight negative correlation |

- **Study time** is the strongest predictor (coefficient: +2.04)
- Students who study more hours consistently achieve higher grades
- **Recommendation**: Focus interventions on improving study habits

### 2. **Past Performance Predicts Future**
- Previous grades (G1, G2) are strong predictors
- **Early warning system** possible using first semester grades
- **Recommendation**: Monitor students with low G1/G2 scores

### 3. **Failures Have Lasting Impact**
- Each previous failure reduces final grade by ~1.4 points
